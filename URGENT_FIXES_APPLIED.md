# 🔧 Urgent Fixes Applied - Interview App Issues

## Date: October 5, 2025

This document explains the two critical issues that were causing your app to crash and the solutions that have been applied.

---

## ❌ Issue #1: AssemblyAI Transcription Error

### The Problem

```
Error: Failed to submit transcription request. Status: 400
Body: {"error": "language_detection is not available when language_code is specified."}
```

### Root Cause

AssemblyAI's API does not allow both `language_detection: true` and `language_code: 'en'` to be set at the same time.

### ✅ Solution Applied

- **File Modified:** `lib/features/5_interview/services/assembly_ai_service.dart`
- **Change:** Added a clear warning comment to prevent accidentally including `language_detection` parameter
- **Status:** The current code is already correct (no `language_detection` parameter present)

### 🚨 IMPORTANT - Action Required by You

If you're still seeing this error, it means you have a **cached build**. You MUST do a clean rebuild:

```powershell
# Run these commands in your terminal:
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

This will clear all cached files and rebuild the app from scratch, using the corrected code.

## ❌ Issue #2: Database 404 Error (App Crash)

### The Problem

```
Error: PostgrestException(message: {}, code: 404, details: Not Found)
```

This error occurs when trying to save interview results, causing the app to crash.

### Root Cause

The `interview_results` table **does not exist** in your Supabase database. The app is trying to insert data into a table that hasn't been created yet.

### ✅ Solution Applied

- **File Modified:** `lib/features/5_interview/services/database_service.dart`
- **Change:** Added improved error handling with clear instructions when this error occurs
- **Status:** Code now shows helpful debug messages pointing to the solution

### 🚨 CRITICAL - Action Required by You

**You MUST create the database table before the app will work properly.**

#### Steps to Fix:

1. **Open your Supabase Dashboard:**

   - Go to https://app.supabase.com
   - Select your project

2. **Open the SQL Editor:**

   - Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
   - Click "New Query"

3. **Run the database_fix.sql script:**

   - Open the file `database_fix.sql` from your project root
   - Copy the ENTIRE contents
   - Paste into the SQL Editor in Supabase
   - Click "Run" or press Ctrl+Enter

4. **Verify the table was created:**
   - Go to "Table Editor" in the left sidebar
   - Look for a table named `interview_results`
   - You should see columns like: id, interview_session_id, user_id, job_role_id, overall_score, etc.

#### What the Script Does:

- ✅ Creates the `interview_results` table
- ✅ Sets up proper foreign key relationships
- ✅ Adds Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- ✅ Adds the missing `problem_solving_score` column to `interview_sessions`
