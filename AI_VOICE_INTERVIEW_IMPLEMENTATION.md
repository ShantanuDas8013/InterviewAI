3. **Real-time Voice Interaction**: Text-to-Speech for AI questions and Speech-to-Text for user answers
4. **10-Question Interview Flow**: Based on selected job role and difficulty level
5. **Call Disconnect Functionality**: User can end interview anytime
6. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Detailed performance analysis with scoring and feedback
7. **Audio Storage**: Recordings stored in Supabase storage buckets

## System Architecture

### Core Services

#### 1. TextToSpeechService (`text_to_speech_service.dart`)

- **Purpose**: Makes the AI "speak" interview questions
- **Features**:
  - Voice configuration (speed, pitch, volume)
  - Async completion handling
  - Error handling and recovery
  - Background/foreground management

#### 2. SpeechToTextService (`speech_to_text_service.dart`)

- **Purpose**: Records and processes user audio responses
- **Features**:
  - Audio recording with amplitude monitoring
  - Real-time voice visualization data
  - Supabase storage integration
  - Audio file upload and URL generation

#### 3. InterviewService (`interview_service.dart`)

- **Purpose**: Manages interview logic and AI evaluation
- **Features**:
  - Session creation and management
  - Question fetching from database
  - Gemini AI integration for answer evaluation
  - Result generation and analysis

### Interview Flow

#### Phase 1: Interview Setup

1. User selects job role in `InterviewSetupScreen`
2. System validates user profile and resume
3. Creates interview session in database
4. Fetches relevant questions based on job role and difficulty

#### Phase 2: Interview Execution (InterviewScreen)

1. **Initialization**:

   - Load TTS and STT services
   - Initialize session with 10 questions
   - Setup voice visualization

2. **Question-Answer Cycle**:

   ```
   For each question:
   ├── AI speaks question (TTS)
   ├── User listens (voice visualization shows AI speaking)
   ├── User responds (STT recording + amplitude monitoring)
   ├── AI evaluates answer (Gemini AI)
   ├── Store response with audio URL
   └── Move to next question
   ```

3. **Early Termination**:
   - User can disconnect anytime
   - System generates results for answered questions
   - Graceful cleanup of audio resources

#### Phase 3: Results Analysis (InterviewResultScreen)

1. **Score Calculation**:

   - Individual question scores (0-10)
   - Category breakdowns (Technical, Communication, Problem-solving, Confidence)
   - Overall weighted score

2. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - User's actual answers
   - Ideal expected answers
   - AI feedback for each response
   - Areas of strength and improvement
   - Comprehensive summary

## User Interface Design

### Interview Screen - Call Interface

- **Design**: Mimics a professional audio call interface
- **Components**:
  - AI avatar with status indicators
  - Voice activity visualizer (blue for AI, green for user)
  - Question display area
  - Progress indicator
  - Call control buttons (mic, end call)
  - Timer for response limits

### Visual States

1. **Ready**: Green status, mic button enabled
2. **AI Speaking**: Blue rings, volume icon, AI speaking animation
3. **User Recording**: Green rings, stop button, voice wave animation
4. **Processing**: Orange status, loading indicator
5. **Completed**: Results navigation

## Database Integration

### Tables Used

1. **interview_sessions**: Session metadata and scores
2. **interview_questions**: Question bank by job role
3. **interview_responses**: User answers with audio URLs
4. **interview_results**: Final analysis and scores

### Storage Buckets

1. **interview-audio**: Voice recordings (WAV format)
2. Path structure: `interview-audio/{session_id}/question_{number}_{timestamp}.wav`

## AI Integration (Gemini)

### Question Evaluation

- **Input**: Question text, user answer, expected keywords, sample answer
- **Process**: AI analyzes response quality, relevance, and completeness
- **Output**: Score (0-10), feedback, ideal answer comparison

### Final Analysis

- **Input**: All question-answer pairs with scores
- **Process**: Comprehensive performance analysis
- **Output**: Strengths, improvements, summary

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management (InterviewProvider)

```dart
enum InterviewStatus {
  initializing,
  ready,
  askingQuestion,
  listeningToAnswer,
  processingAnswer,
  completed,
  error,
}
```

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Voice Visualization

- Real-time amplitude monitoring
- Different colors for AI vs user speech
- Smooth animations with proper cleanup

#### 2. Error Handling

- TTS/STT service failures
- Network connectivity issues
- Gemini AI rate limits
- Graceful degradation

#### 3. Performance Optimization

- Efficient audio processing
- Background service management
- Memory cleanup on disposal

## Usage Instructions

### For Users

1. **Start Interview**: Select job role and difficulty in setup screen
2. **During Interview**:
   - Tap microphone to start each question
   - AI will speak the question
   - Respond clearly when recording starts
   - Can end interview anytime with disconnect button
3. **View Results**: Detailed analysis with scores and feedback

### For Developers

1. **Dependencies**: Ensure flutter_tts, flutter_sound, provider are installed
2. **Permissions**: Microphone permissions required
3. **Environment**: Gemini API key and Supabase configuration needed
