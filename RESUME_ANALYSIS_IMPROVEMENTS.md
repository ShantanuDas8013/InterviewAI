- **Solution**: Updated `ResumeRepository.saveResumeAnalysis()` to properly map Gemini AI response to correct database fields
- **Changes**:
  - Fixed field mapping to match actual database schema
  - Added proper data extraction for skills, experience, education, ATS optimization, and keyword analysis
  - Added `_normalizeScore()` method to ensure scores are within 0-10 range

### 2. Enhanced Gemini AI Analysis

- **Improvements**:
  - More detailed and specific prompts for comprehensive resume analysis
  - Better JSON response validation and parsing
  - Enhanced fallback analysis when JSON parsing fails
  - Improved error handling and recovery mechanisms

### 3. Robust PDF Text Extraction

- **Enhancements**:
  - Better PDF validation (checking PDF signature)
  - Improved text cleaning and validation
  - More informative error messages for extraction failures
  - Fallback analysis when PDF text extraction fails

### 4. Improved Resume Service

- **Features**:
  - Enhanced download and text extraction process
  - Better error handling for network issues
  - Progress tracking for PDF downloads
  - Metadata enhancement for analysis results
  - Structured fallback prompts when PDF extraction fails

## Technical Improvements

### Database Integration

```dart
// Fixed mapping to actual database columns
final analysisRecord = {
  'resume_id': resumeId,
  'user_id': userId,
  'overall_score': _normalizeScore(analysisData['overallScore']),
  'overall_feedback': analysisData['overallFeedback']?.toString(),
  'extracted_skills': extractedSkills,
  'extracted_experience_years': experienceData?['yearsOfExperience'],
  'extracted_education_level': educationData?['educationLevel'],
  'extracted_companies': companies,
  'extracted_job_titles': jobTitles,
  'relevant_keywords': relevantKeywords,
  'missing_keywords': missingKeywords,
  'ats_score': atsOptimization?['score'],
  'ats_issues': atsIssues,
  'gemini_analysis_raw': analysisData,
};
```

### Enhanced AI Prompt

- More specific analysis requirements
- Detailed JSON structure specification
- Industry-specific guidance
- Better examples and instructions

### PDF Processing

```dart
// Enhanced PDF text extraction with validation
String _cleanAndValidateExtractedText(String rawText) {
  // Clean formatting
  // Validate content length
  // Check for resume-specific content
  // Provide meaningful feedback
}
```

### Error Recovery

- Intelligent fallback analysis when primary methods fail
- Structured prompts based on file metadata
- Comprehensive error messages with improvement suggestions

## User Experience Improvements

### Progress Indicators

- More detailed progress messages during analysis
- Time estimates for analysis completion
- Better visual feedback
