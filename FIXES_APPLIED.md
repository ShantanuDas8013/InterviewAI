# AI Voice Interview App - Issues Fixed

## Fixed Issues Summary

### 1. ✅ **Splash Screen Navigation Issue**

**Problem**: Splash screen was showing for 5 seconds instead of the expected 3 seconds.
**Solution**:

- Reduced splash screen delay from 5 seconds to 3 seconds
- Maintained proper authentication status checking
- Added error handling with fallback navigation

**File**: `lib/features/0_splash/presentation/splash_screen.dart`

### 2. ✅ **Home Screen Profile Drawer Issue**

**Problem**: Profile drawer wasn't opening when tapping the profile picture due to `Scaffold.of()` context error.
**Solution**:

- Wrapped the GestureDetector with a Builder widget to get the correct context
- Used `Scaffold.of(context).openEndDrawer()` instead of `_scaffoldKey.currentState?.openEndDrawer()`

**File**: `lib/features/2_home/presentation/home_screen.dart`

### 3. ✅ **Render Overflow in Feature Cards**

**Problem**: Feature cards were overflowing by 3.5 pixels causing rendering errors.
**Solution**:

- Increased `childAspectRatio` from 1.1 to 1.2 to give more height to cards
- Added `mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min` to prevent overflow
- Wrapped subtitle text in `Flexible` widget
- Reduced spacing between text elements from 4px to 2px

**File**: `lib/features/2_home/presentation/home_screen.dart`

### 4. ✅ **setState() After Dispose Error**

**Problem**: SetState was being called on disposed widgets causing memory leaks.
**Solution**:

- All async operations now check `if (mounted)` before calling setState
- Proper disposal handling in all lifecycle methods
- Error handling with mounted checks

**File**: `lib/features/2_home/presentation/home_screen.dart`
